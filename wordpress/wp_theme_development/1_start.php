1. Sabse pahale `themes` folder me ek folder banaye . or uska name kuchh bhi rakha le 
2. fir folder me jaye or  `index.php` or `style.css` , `screenshot.png
` name ke file bana le 


Note : 
======

Yadi aap style.css name ki file bana lete hai or usme `Theme Name ` nahi dete hai to  by default jis name se 
apne folder banaya hai vahi name le lega 

Very Important Note :
---------------------
do_action( 'init' )      // Fires after WordPress has finished loading but before any headers are sent.
do_action( 'wp_loaded' )    //This hook is fired once WP, all plugins, and the theme are fully loaded and instantiated.

For Parent Theme :
------------------
define( 'BARRA_THEME_VERSION', '3.4.6' );
define( 'BARRA_THEME_DIR', trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) );
define( 'BARRA_THEME_URI', trailingslashit( esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) ) );

For Child Theme : 
----------------
<?php require_once( get_stylesheet_directory(). '/my_included_file.php' ); ?>
<img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/images/my_picture.png" alt="" />

Description: Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the group and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned typography also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor styles give you a good idea of what your content will look like, even before you publish. You can give your site a personal touch by changing the background colors and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of all elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the colors you pick, ensuring a high, accessible color contrast for your visitors.
