git diff : 
---------

git diff            //(it compare two current file and staging file)
git diff HEAD       // It compares from last commit (both stage and unstage)
git diff --staged   //  Diffrence between staging area and last commit 
git diff --cached   // Diffrence between staging area and last commit 

git diff HEAD HEAD~1    //the parent commmit of HEAD (new commit to parent commit )
git diff  HEAD~1        //(parent commit to child )


git diff style/style.css     //compare particular file 
git diff HEAD style/style.css     //compare particular file 

git diff HEAD style/style.css  index.php    //two file compare particular file 

Syntax : git diff branch1..branch2 
git diff master..odd-numbers   // comparing from two branches (current branch is `master` second branch is `odd` and file is `numbers.txt`)

==> comparing using hash (coomit) :
git log --online 
git diff <hash1>..<hash2>
