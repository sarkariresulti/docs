Fork & Clone : Another Workflow -
---------------------------------

Note : jab ham kisi ke project me fork me click karte hai to vo same project hamare repositories me add ho jati hai 
       ap ham chahe to isko jaise vaise use kar sakte hai. 

       2) Get pull pr click karke ham chahe to apne changes ko original repositories me add karne ko de sakte hai.

 
 Rebasing :
---------

1) There are two main ways to use the git rebase commands:
   - as an alternative to merging
   - as a cleanup tool 

   Syntax: git rebase master 

   Example: git switch feature 
            git rebase master 


Rewriting History :
-------------------
Sometimes we want to rewrite , delete rename or even reorder commits (before sharing them ) We can do this using `git rebase`

Interactive Rebase : 
--------------------

Running git rebase with the `-i` option will enter the interactive mode , which allows us to edit comits, add files , 
drop commits etc. Note that we need to specify how far back we want to rewrite commits. 
Also, notice that we are rebasing a series of commits onto the HEAD they currently are based on.

Syntax:  git rebase -i HEAD~4 

What Now ?

In our text editor, we'll see a list of commits alongside a list of commands that we can choose from . Here are a couple 
of the more commonly used commands:

1) pick - use the commit 
2) reword - use the commit, but edit the commit message 
3) edit - use commit , but stop for amending 
4) fixup - use commit contents but meld it into previous commit and discard the commit message. 
5) drop - remove commit
